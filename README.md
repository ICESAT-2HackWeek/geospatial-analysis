# Geospatial Data Exploration, Analysis, and Visualization

### A subset of relevant core concepts and modern geospatial data science approaches for ICESat data analysis*

Instructor: David Shean (dshean@uw.edu)

OK, you've used the API, you've pulled your granules, you've extracted the relevant records and fields, and perhaps even done some initial QA/QC.  Now what?  Let's work through some modern data science tools that can help with analysis and visualization of these point data, leading to rapid data-driven discovery.

## Learning Objectives

* Review fundamental concepts that are common to most geospatial analysis (e.g. coordinate systems, geometry types)
* Learn basic data manipulation and exploration with a relatively small, clean ICESat GLAS dataset
* Use modern data science tools for data exploration, interpretation and visualization
